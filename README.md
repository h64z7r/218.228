2. Assessment Overview
You have been asked to propose an extension (extra bedroom and en-suite bathroom) to an existing residential building (use the given architectural and structural drawings). Please note that the extension must be proposed on the ground level appropriately attaching to the existing building. You will be working as a head-contractor's project manager for this project. Please assume that the existing building is freestanding with plenty of space around for the extension project. According to the client's budget, the possible maximum floor area of the proposed extension is   25m .   You are required to prepare a construction programme and post-contract methodology for the project's superstructure including the wall frames, roof frames, openings and external claddings. The project must be completed within   1 month.
2.1. Main Steps
Step 1:   Provide a brief proposal to your client about your proposed extension's details (dimensions and materials) supplemented with a floor plan. Please note that the floor plan can be sketched manually or using drawing software. The floor plan should clearly show how the extension is attached to the existing building.
Step 2:   Develop a critical-path network diagram including the below items. Suggest using Microsoft (MS) Excel software in this step.
Wall framing, roof framing, openings and external cladding as   main activities (you should separately identify head-contractor activities and sub-contractor activities)
Long-Lead Delivery (LLD) items (e.g., manufacture and deliver metal windows and doors).
Step 3:   Develop a critical-path   base construction programme   using MS Project. Show the work breakdown structure (WBS) in the base programme.
Step 4: Complete the following table for all   head-contractor activities (you need to select and justify them).

Estimate (there is no need to explain the details of your estimation) the sub-contractor's activity durations. Enter the durations from your completed Post-Contract Methodology and the estimated sub-contractor activity durations into the base c代 写218.228: Planning & Digital Built Environment for Construction ManagersPython

Step 5:   Add resources and their rates in the resource sheet in MS Project. Assign resources to the activities completed by the head-contractor. Add the cost of sub-contractor activities. If needed, perform. resource levelling and resource smoothing for head-contractor’s activities.
Step 6:   Prepare the   as-built construction programme   to account for the following:
During wall panel installation, the head-contractor uncovered incorrectly treated timber used in wall panels. Works were subsequently delayed for 1 week while the supplier re-supplied new timber wall panels.
Following an agreement with all parties, the contract administrator instructs you to accelerate your programme to achieve the original completion date.
Step 7:   Prepare an   accelerated construction programme   to achieve your original (base programme) completion date. Clearly identify which tasks you have accelerated and justify your selection. If needed, perform. resource levelling and resource smoothing for head-contractor's activities.
Step 8:   Use the accelerated construction programme to produce schedule-oriented information (e.g. critical task report, project overview report, resource status report, etc) for the critical activities. Explain the reports produced for the client.
Step 9:   Create a MS PowerPoint presentation to present your work to the client. Do the presentation on Zoom or MS Teams and video record it.   The recording needs to be between 8 mins to 10 mins long. Your face must be visible in the video. You must include the below items in your presentation.
1. Introduction to the project
2. Describe the proposed extension (floor plan and materials used: framing, openings and external cladding)
3. Network diagram
4. Head-contractor activities and sub-contractor activities
5. Post-contract methodology table
6. An example sub-contractor activity duration calculation/estimation
7. The base construction programme (you could use the MS Project file in the presentation)
8. Resource sheet, assigned resources, resource levelling, and resource smoothing conducted (you could use the MS Project file in the presentation)
9.    As-built and accelerated construction programmes (you could use the MS Projects file in the presentation)
10. Shedule-oriented information produced for the client.
Step 9: Submit the following files to the Assessment 1 submission link on the Stream site.
1. The video presentation file in MP4 format
2. The network diagram (suggest a MS Excel file)
3. The base construction programme (MS Project file)
4. The as-built programme (MS Project file)
5. The accelerated programme (MS Project file)
6. References (references to duration and cost estimation work – this can be a MS Excel or MS Word file)
